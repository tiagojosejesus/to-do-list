## Code
This project uses different **React Hooks** to the code be more clean and clear to the developer that want to read it. It uses **React Hooks** instead of **props**, because it's a more clean programmation and more responsive. 

### useState
```react
const [inputText, setInputText] = useState("");
```
This constante is used to recive and store the text inputed by the user in the `Form` component.

```react
const [todo, setTodo] = useState([]);
```
This constante stores an array that recives 3 parameters. It recives an `id`, the `inputText` and a state `completed`.
> The `id` is generated by a random function, so that this nunber never repeat. <br> The `inputText` is the variable that the user input. This will be recived from the `<input type="text" />` in the `Form` component. <br> The `completed` is a boolean used to filter the list when an `option` of the `select` is chose.

```react
const [status, setStatus] = useState('all');
```
This is used to store the state that the `select` is on. This is used to filter the ToDo's in the list created.

```react
const [filteredTodos, setFilteredTodos] = useState([]);
```
This constante is used to store the ToDo's with a `completed` or an `uncompleted` state. Is used to modified the list of ToDo's to print just the list with the `status` that is selected. 

### useEffect
